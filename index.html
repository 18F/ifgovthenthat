        <h3>What is this project?</h3>
        <p>Right now, it's just conceptual. We're learning about government open data, APIs, and how to collaborate on GitHub. Everyone is welcome!</p>
        <h3>How can you contribute?</h3>
        <p>Any level of tech skill can contribute to this project. You might be especially interested in joining if you want to learn more about APIs, government open data, or GitHub.</p>
        <p>Here are a few ways you can get involved:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Understand the concept:</strong> If you're totally new to this, you should start by checking out <a href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That</a>. This idea is based on that site, and we will use some of their jargon like trigger, action, and recipes.</li>
          <li><strong>Get creative:</strong></li> You could start by just brainstorming government services and how they might fit into a recipe. Perhaps browsing through <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes">IFTTT recipes</a> or <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=api">government APIs</a> could jumpstart your creativity.
          <li><strong>Find Useful Gov Data:</strong> Look through this list of <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes">IFTTT recipes</a> or <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=api">government APIs</a> for data in the APIs that could be useful for this project. Add your idea and a link to the feed in the list below.</li>
          <li><strong>Help Organize:</strong> You could help by organizing the list below.</li>
          <li><strong>Learn more about APIs:</strong> You can learn more about APIs on <a href="http://codeacademy.org/">Code Academy</a>. (Any other good recommendations?)</li>
          <lie><strong>Come to Code for DC:</strong> I'll be working on this and teaching GitHub at <a href="http://codefordc.org">Code for DC</a>. Join us!</lie>
