* if census releases economic indicator above/below something
* government status changes (opm.gov/status)
* USAJobs, FOIA, Federal Register keywords come up
* CPSC recalls - Jed Sundwall
* New entries on regulations.gov - @alandelevie
* TSA security line wait times reach a certain time
* I would say 'farmers market opens for the year' but think that the metadata for that API isn't parsed out well enough for that.  - @gbinal
* I wonder if it'd be possible to use the NREL API to power something that would alert you whenever there's a new alternative fuel station that opens within a certain geographic area... - @gbinal
* Maybe airport status (not quite the same as line times)?  E.G.  Triggers that are based off of an airport getting shut down.  I feel like many frequent flyers would be interested in getting a heads up of an event like this morning's at LAX for any airport in the lower 48, not just certain ones.  - @gbinal
* A we the people petition passes x number of signatures, includes x keywords
* "I had always envisioned agencies pushing each of their posts from any platform into an open Google Calendar so they can better see the spread of coverage between their sub-agencies, etc, and there would also be an easy to evaluate record for the public." - Justin Herman
* Do a "cook-off"/hackathon w/ fed devs and IFTTT folks - @erie
* If Natural Disaster (per NOAA) then Resources (localized per GPS) (FEMA) + (CDC) + (HHS) + (Coast Guard) + (National Guard) @hobokenmartha
* Link to Google Docs / Dropbox so that APIs with information can be downloaded easily and tracked by people who may have uses for them that we can't think of. - @mkramer
* Connect all projects to Google Drive or Dropbox for people to collect information for future projects that we might not be aware of yet. (i.e. information about clinical trials, etc.) - @mkramer
* If natural disaster happens, publish data from National Map: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/the-national-map - @mkramer
* If a certain person or organization visits the White House (use White House visitor log API) notify me by email/tweet it/etc. - @mkramer
* If it's my birthday, send me a random newspaper from my birthday that's been digitized by the Library of Congress: http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/ -@mkramer
* If the government creates a new social media account (http://registery.usa.gov) follow them/tweet about it/etc.

Potential Material
* [Developer Hubs](http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/data/developer_hubs) 
* [Individual APIs](https://github.com/GSA/slash-developer-pages/blob/master/Loose_APIs.md) 


logistics/questions
--

* Start by turning triggers into RSS feeds and promoting IFTTT recipes with them? Popular (albeit pointless) example: Text me when CDC reports a Zombie outbreak https://ifttt.com/recipes/48155
* GSA is working with IFTTT now... updates appreciated...
* Research YQL and Yahoo Pipes
* https://github.com/ottawaruby/whenbot -- A simple web service that runs on Heroku that lets you
listen on certain triggers and perform actions to other web services
based on that.
* https://github.com/cantino/huginn - an ifttt clone
* https://github.com/ggaughan/pipe2py/ - a way to compile pipes with python
* http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ -- to scrape web.
