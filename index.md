### What is this project?

Our goal is to promote government APIs and learn more about them. We are creating clever uses for gov APIs. So, for example, one of our ideas is for you to receive a text message if the lines at your airport are longer than 40 minutes (based on the [TSA API](https://apps.tsa.dhs.gov/mytsa/wait_times_detail.aspx). Another idea is for you to receive an email with a different, random newspaper cover from that day in history (based on a [Library of Congress API](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/)).

### How can you contribute?

Any level of tech skill can contribute to this project. You might be especially interested in joining if you want to learn more about APIs, government open data, or GitHub.
  
  
Here are a few ways you can get involved:

* **Get creative:** You could start by just brainstorming government services and how they might be used: [government APIs](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=api). [Add your ideas here](https://github.com/18f/ifgovthenthat).
* **Learn more about APIs:** You can learn more about APIs on [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org/). (Any other good recommendations?)
